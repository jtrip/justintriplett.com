This is ostensibly a test of te pygments code viewing feature in Pelican.  
This Post currently has the status: Draft, so it should not be published with the rest of the output.

	import test

	class crap(test):
		def a.thing()

	def crap.this_should_be_a_test(proof):
		'''
		Docmentation is very important
		'''

		example = verify(proof)
		print "bad python2 response"
		return example

	<since this_code=dose_not_work effort="less">
		things are really bad
	</since>

	if (this helps) {
		maybe.it is because->it
		does not care about language
	}
